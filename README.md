## Dragon BallZ Sphere Manager

Learning to build an application to manage the Dragon Balls, validating whether we can invoke Shenron and ensuring the quality of the software and that it has no flaws. The application is in React and we use the react testing library, jest and Cypress, which are essential testing tools.
